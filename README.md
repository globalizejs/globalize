# Globalize

A JavaScript library for globalization and localization. Enables complex
culture-aware number and date parsing and formatting, including the raw
culture information for hundreds of different languages and countries, as well
as an extensible system for localization.

<a name="why"></a>
<h2 id="why">Why Globalization?</h2>
<p>
Each language, and the countries that speak that language, have different
expectations when it comes to how numbers (including currency and percentages)
and dates should appear. Obviously, each language has different names for the
days of the week and the months of the year. But they also have different
expectations for the structure of dates, such as what order the day, month and
year are in. In number formatting, not only does the character used to
delineate number groupings and the decimal portion differ, but the placement of
those characters differ as well.
</p>
<p>
A user using an application should be able to read and write dates and numbers
in the format they are accustomed to. This library makes this possible,
providing an API to convert user-entered number and date strings - in their
own format - into actual numbers and dates, and conversely, to format numbers
and dates into that string format.
</p>

<a name="what"></a>
<h2 id="what">What is a Culture?</h2>
<p>
Globalize defines roughly 350 cultures. Part of the reason for this large
number, besides there being a lot of cultures in the world, is because for
some languages, expectations differ among the countries that speak it.
English, for example, is an official language in dozens of countries. Despite
the language being English, the expected date formatting still greatly differs
between them.
</p>
<p>
So, it does not seem useful to define cultures by their language alone. Nor
is it useful to define a culture by its country alone, as many countries have
several official languages, spoken by sizable populations. Therefore, cultures
are defined as a combination of the language and the country speaking it. Each
culture is given a unique code that is a combination of an ISO 639 two-letter
lowercase culture code for the language, and a two-letter uppercase code for
the country or region. For example, "en-US" is the culture code for English in
the United States.
</p>
<p>
Yet, it is perhaps unreasonable to expect application developers to cater to
every possible language/country combination perfectly. It is important then to
define so-called "neutral" cultures based on each language. These cultures
define the most likely accepted set of rules by anyone speaking that language,
whatever the country. Neutral cultures are defined only by their language code.
For example, "es" is the neutral culture for Spanish.
</p>

<a name="addCultureInfo"></a>
<h2 id="addCultureInfo">Globalize.addCultureInfo( cultureName, extendCultureName, info )</h2>
<p>
This method allows you to create a new culture based on an existing culture or
add to existing culture info. If the optional argument <pre>extendCultureName</pre>
is not supplied, it will extend the existing culture if it exists or create a new
culture based on the default culture if it doesn't exist. If cultureName is not
supplied, it will add the supplied info to the current culture. See .culture().
</p>


<a name="cultures"></a>
<h2 id="cultures">Globalize.cultures</h2>
<p>
A mapping of culture codes to culture objects. For example,
Globalize.cultures.fr is an object representing the complete culture
definition for the neutral French culture. Note that the main globalize.js file
alone only includes a neutral English culture. To get additional cultures, you
must include one or more of the culture scripts that come with it. You
can see in the section <a href="#defining">Defining Culture Information</a>
below which fields are defined in each culture.
</p>

<a name="culture"></a>
<h2 id="culture">Globalize.culture( selector )</h2>
<p>
An application that supports globalization and/or localization will need to
have a way to determine the user's preference. Attempting to automatically
determine the appropriate culture is useful, but it is good practice to always
offer the user a choice, by whatever means.
</p>
<p>
Whatever your mechanism, it is likely that you will have to correlate the
user's preferences with the list of cultures supported in the app. This
method allows you to select the best match given the culture scripts that you
have included and to set the Globalize culture to the culture which the user
prefers.
</p>
<p>
If you pass an array of names instead of a single name string, the first
culture for which there is a match (that culture's script has been referenced)
will be used. If none match, the search restarts using the corresponding
neutral cultures. For example, if the application has included only the neutral
"fr" culture, any of these would select it:
<pre>
Globalize.culture( "fr" );
console.log( Globalize.culture().name ) // "fr"

Globalize.culture( "fr-FR" );
console.log( Globalize.culture().name ) // "fr-FR"

Globalize.culture([ "es-MX", "fr-FR" ]);
console.log( Globalize.culture().name ) // "es-MX"
</pre>

In any case, if no match is found, the neutral English culture "en" is selected
by default.

If you don't pass a selector, .culture() will return the current Globalize
culture.
</p>
<p>
Each culture string may also follow the pattern defined in
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.4"
>RFC2616 sec 14.4</a>. That is, a culture name may include a "quality" value
that indicates an estimate of the user's preference for the language.

<pre>
Globalize.culture( "fr;q=0.4, es;q=0.5, he" );
</pre>
In this example, the neutral Hebrew culture "he" is given top priority (an
unspecified quality is equal to 1). If that language is not an exact match for
any of the cultures available in Globalize.cultures, then "es" is the next
highest priority with 0.5, etc. If none of these match, just like with the array
syntax, the search starts over and the same rules are applied to the
corresponding neutral language culture for each. If still none match, the
neutral English culture "en" is used.
</p>

<a name="find"></a>
<h2 id="find">Globalize.findClosestCulture( selector )</h2>
<p>
Just like .culture( selector ), but it just returns the matching culture, if
any, without setting it to the current Globalize culture, returned by
.culture().
</p>

<a name="format"></a>
<h2 id="format">Globalize.format( value, format, culture )</h2>
<p>
Formats a date or number according to the given format string and the given
culture (or the current culture if not specified). See the sections
<a href="#numbers">Number Formatting</a> and
<a href="#dates">Date Formatting</a> below for details on the available
formats.
<pre>
// assuming a culture with number grouping of 3 digits,
// using "," separator and "." decimal symbol.
Globalize.format( 1234.567, "n" ); // "1,234.57"
Globalize.format( 1234.567, "n1" ); // "1,234.6"
Globalize.format( 1234.567, "n0" ); // "1,235"

// assuming a culture with "/" as the date separator symbol
Globalize.format( new Date(1955,10,5), "yyyy/MM/dd" ); // "1955/11/05"
Globalize.format( new Date(1955,10,5), "dddd MMMM d, yyyy" ); // "Saturday November 5, 1955"
</pre>
</p>

<a name="localize"></a>
<h2 id="localize">Globalize.localize( key, culture )</h2>
<p>
Gets or sets a localized value. This method allows you to extend the
information available to a particular culture, and to easily retrieve it
without worrying about finding the most appropriate culture. For example, to
define the word "translate" in French:
<pre>
Globalize.addCultureInfo( "fr", {
	messages: {
		"translate": "traduire"
	}
});
console.log( Globalize.localize( "translate", "fr" ) ); // "traduire"
</pre>
Note that localize() will find the closest match available per the same
semantics as the Globalize.findClosestCulture() method. If there is no
match, the translation given is for the neutral English culture "en" by
default.
</p>


<a name="parseInt"></a>
<h2 id="parseInt">Globalize.parseInt( value, radix, culture )</h2>
<p>
Parses a string representing a whole number in the given radix (10 by default),
taking into account any formatting rules followed by the given culture (or the
current culture, if not specified).
<pre>
// assuming a culture where "," is the group separator
// and "." is the decimal separator
Globalize.parseInt( "1,234.56" ); // 1234
// assuming a culture where "." is the group separator
// and "," is the decimal separator
Globalize.parseInt( "1.234,56" ); // 1234
</pre>
</p>

<a name="parseFloat"></a>
<h2 id="parseFloat">Globalize.parseFloat( value, radix, culture )</h2>
<p>
Parses a string representing a floating point number in the given radix (10 by
default), taking into account any formatting rules followed by the given
culture (or the current culture, if not specified).
<pre>
// assuming a culture where "," is the group separator
// and "." is the decimal separator
Globalize.parseFloat( "1,234.56" ); // 1234.56
// assuming a culture where "." is the group separator
// and "," is the decimal separator
Globalize.parseFloat( "1.234,56" ); // 1234.56
</pre>
</p>

<a name="parseDate"></a>
<h2 id="parseDate">Globalize.parseDate( value, formats, culture )</h2>
<p>
Parses a string representing a date into a JavaScript Date object, taking into
account the given possible formats (or the given culture's set of default
formats if not given). As before, the current culture is used if one is not
specified.
<pre>
Globalize.culture( "en" );
Globalize.parseDate( "1/2/2003" ); // Thu Jan 02 2003
Globalize.culture( "fr" );
Globalize.parseDate( "1/2/2003" ); // Sat Feb 01 2003
</pre>
</p>

<a name="extend"></a>
<h2 id="extend">Utilizing and Extending Cultures</h2>
<p>
The culture information included with each culture is mostly necessary for the
parsing and formatting methods, but not all of it. For example, the Native and
English names for each culture is given, as well as a boolean indicating
whether the language is right-to-left. This may be useful information for your
own purposes. You may also add to the culture information directly if so
desired.
</p>
<p>
As an example, in the U.S., the word "billion" means the number 1,000,000,000
(9 zeros). But in other countries, that number is "1000 million" or a
"milliard", and a billion is 1,000,000,000,000 (12 zeros). If you needed to
provide functionality to your app or custom plugin that needed to know how many
zeros are in a "billion", you could extend the culture information as follows:
<pre>
// define additional culture information for a possibly existing culture
Globalize.addCultureInfo( "fr", {
	numberFormat: {
		billionZeroes: 12
	}
});
</pre>
Using this mechanism, the "fr" culture will be created if it does not exist.
And if it does, the given values will be added to it.
</p>

<a name="defining"></a>
<h2 id="defining">Defining Culture Information</h2>
<p>
Each culture is defined in its own script with the naming scheme
globalize.culture.&lt;name&gt;.js. You may include any number of these scripts,
making them available in the Globalize.cultures mapping. Including one of
these scripts does NOT automatically make it the current culture selected in the
Globalize.culture property.
</p>
<p>
The neutral English culture is defined directly in globalize.js, and set
both to the properties "en" and "default" of the Globalize.cultures mapping.
Extensive comments describe the purpose of each of the fields defined.
</p>
<p>
Looking at the source code of the scripts for each culture, you will notice
that each script uses Globalize.addCultureInfo() to have the "default" neutral
English culture "en", as a common basis, and defines only the properties that
differ from neutral English.
</p>
<p>
The neutral English culture is listed here along with the comments:
<pre>
Globalize.cultures[ "default" ] = {
	// A unique name for the culture in the form
	// &lt;language code&gt;-&lt;country/region code&gt;
	name: "English",
	// the name of the culture in the English language
	englishName: "English",
	// the name of the culture in its own language
	nativeName: "English",
	// whether the culture uses right-to-left text
	isRTL: false,
	// "language" is used for so-called "specific" cultures.
	// For example, the culture "es-CL" means Spanish in Chili.
	// It represents the Spanish-speaking culture as it is in Chili,
	// which might have different formatting rules or even translations
	// than Spanish in Spain. A "neutral" culture is one that is not
	// specific to a region. For example, the culture "es" is the generic
	// Spanish culture, which may be a more generalized version of the language
	// that may or may not be what a specific culture expects.
	// For a specific culture like "es-CL", the "language" field refers to the
	// neutral, generic culture information for the language it is using.
	// This is not always a simple matter of the string before the dash.
	// For example, the "zh-Hans" culture is neutral (Simplified Chinese).
	// And the "zh-SG" culture is Simplified Chinese in Singapore, whose
	// language field is "zh-CHS", not "zh".
	// This field should be used to navigate from a specific culture to its
	// more general, neutral culture. If a culture is already as general as it
	// can get, the language may refer to itself.

	// "numberFormat" defines general number formatting rules, like the digits
	// in each grouping, the group separator, and how negative numbers are
	// displayed.

<p>
Each culture can have several possible calendars. The calendar named "standard"
is the default calendar used by that culture. You may change the calendar in
use by setting the "calendar" field. Take a look at the calendars defined by
each culture by looking at the script or enumerating its calendars collection.
<pre>
// switch to a non-standard calendar
Globalize.culture().calendar = Globalize.culture().calendars.SomeOtherCalendar;
// back to the standard calendar
Globalize.culture().calendar = Globalize.culture().calendars.standard;
</pre>

</p>

<a name="numbers"></a>
<h2 id="numbers">Number Formatting</h2>
<p>
When formatting a number with format(), the main purpose is to convert the
number into a human readable string using the culture's standard grouping and
decimal rules. The rules between cultures can vary a lot. For example, in some
cultures, the grouping of numbers is done unevenly. In the "te-IN" culture
(Telugu in India), groups have 3 digits and then 2 digits. The number 1000000
(one million) is written as "10,00,000". Some cultures do not group numbers at
all.
</p>
<p>
There are four main types of number formatting:
<ul>
<li><strong>n</strong> for number</li>
<li><strong>d</strong> for decimal digits</li>
<li><strong>p</strong> for percentage</li>
<li><strong>c</strong> for currency</li>
</ul>
Even within the same culture, the formatting rules can vary between these four
types of numbers. For example, the expected number of decimal places may differ
from the number format to the currency format. Each format token may also be
followed by a number. The number determines how many decimal places to display
for all the format types except decimal, for which it means the minimum number
of digits to display, zero padding it if necessary. Also note that the way
negative numbers are represented in each culture can vary, such as what the
negative sign is, and whether the negative sign appears before or after the
number. This is especially apparent with currency formatting, where many
cultures use parentheses instead of a negative sign.
<pre>
// just for example - will vary by culture
Globalize.format( 123.45, "n" ); // 123.45
Globalize.format( 123.45, "n0" ); // 123
Globalize.format( 123.45, "n1" ); // 123.5

Globalize.format( 123.45, "d" ); // 123
Globalize.format( 12, "d3" ); // 012

Globalize.format( 123.45, "c" ); // $123.45
Globalize.format( 123.45, "c0" ); // $123
Globalize.format( 123.45, "c1" ); // $123.5
Globalize.format( -123.45, "c" ); // ($123.45)

Globalize.format( 0.12345, "p" ); // 12.35 %
Globalize.format( 0.12345, "p0" ); // 12 %
Globalize.format( 0.12345, "p4" ); // 12.3450 %
</pre>
Parsing with parseInt and parseFloat also accepts any of these formats.
</p>

<a name="dates"></a>
<h2 id="dates">Date Formatting</h2>
<p>
Date formatting varies wildly by culture, not just in the spelling of month and
day names, and the date separator, but by the expected order of the various
date components, whether to use a 12 or 24 hour clock, and how months and days
are abbreviated. Many cultures even include "genitive" month names, which are
different from the typical names and are used only in certain cases.
</p>
<p>
Also, each culture has a set of "standard" or "typical" formats. For example,
in "en-US", when displaying a date in its fullest form, it looks like
"Saturday, November 05, 1955". Note the non-abbreviated day and month name, the
zero padded date, and four digit year. So, Globalize expects a certain set
of "standard" formatting strings for dates in the "patterns" property of the
"standard" calendar of each culture, that describe specific formats for the
culture. The third column shows example values in the neutral English culture
"en-US"; see the second table for the meaning tokens used in date formats.
<table>
<tr>
  <th>Format</th>
  <th>Meaning</th>
  <th>"en-US"</th>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>f</td>
   <td>Long Date, Short Time</td>
   <td>dddd, MMMM dd, yyyy h:mm tt</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>F</td>
   <td>Long Date, Long Time</td>
   <td>dddd, MMMM dd, yyyy h:mm:ss tt</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>t</td>
   <td>Short Time</td>
   <td>h:mm tt</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>T</td>
   <td>Long Time</td>
   <td>h:mm:ss tt</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>d</td>
   <td>Short Date</td>
   <td>M/d/yyyy</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>D</td>
   <td>Long Date</td>
   <td>dddd, MMMM dd, yyyy</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>Y</td>
   <td>Month/Year</td>
   <td>MMMM, yyyy</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>M</td>
   <td>Month/Day</td>
   <td>yyyy MMMM</td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>
In addition to these standard formats, there is the "S" format. This is a
sortable format that is identical in every culture:
"<strong>yyyy'-'MM'-'dd'T'HH':'mm':'ss</strong>".
</p>
<p>
When more specific control is needed over the formatting, you may use any
format you wish by specifying the following custom tokens:
<table>
<tr>
   <th>Token</th>
   <th>Meaning</th>
   <th>Example</th>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>d</td>
   <td>Day of month (no leading zero)</td>
   <td>5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>dd</td>
   <td>Day of month (leading zero)</td>
