h1. Globalize2

Globalize2 is the successor of Globalize for Rails. 

It is compatible with and builds on the new "I18n api in Ruby on Rails":http://rails-i18n.org and adds model translations as well as a bunch of other useful features, such as Locale fallbacks (RFC4647 compliant) and automatic loading of Locale data from defined directory/file locations.

Globalize2 is much more lightweight and modular than its predecessor was. Content translations in Globalize2 use default ActiveRecord features and do not limit any functionality any more. 

All features and tools in Globalize2 are implemented in the most unobstrusive and loosely-coupled way possible, so you can pick whatever features or tools you need for your application and combine them with other tools from other libraries or plugins.

h2. Installation

To install Globalize2 with its default setup just use:

<pre><code>
script/plugin install git://github.com/joshmh/globalize2.git
</code></pre>

This will:

* activate model translations
* set I18n.load_path to an instance of Globalize::LoadPath
* set I18n.backend to an instance of Globalize::Backend::Static

h2. Configuration

You might want to add additional configuration to an initializer, e.g. config/initializers/globalize.rb

h2. Model translations

Model translations (or content translations) allow you to translate your models' attribute values. E.g.

<pre><code>
class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
  translates :title, :text
end
</code></pre>

Allows you to values for the attributes :title and :text per locale:

<pre><code>
I18n.locale = :en
post.title # Globalize2 rocks!

I18n.locale = :he
post.title # גלובאלייז2 שולט!
</code></pre>

In order to make this work you currently need to take care of creating the appropriate database migrations manually. Globalize2 will provide a handy helper method for doing this in future.

The migration for the above Post model could look like this:

<pre><code>
class CreatePosts < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def self.up
    create_table :posts do |t|
      t.timestamps
    end

    create_table :post_translations do |t|
      t.string     :locale
      t.references :post
      t.string     :title
      t.text       :text
    end
  end

  def self.down
    drop_table :posts
  end
end
</code></pre>
